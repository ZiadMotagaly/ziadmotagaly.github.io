Welcome to my personal page! Here's a little about me:

"A jack of all trades, master of none,
though oftentimes better than master of one"

I am an autoditact, that had the good fortune to grow up in many different countries around the world throughtout my whole life. I am currently based in France, which is my 7th country. I moved a lot due to my parents work, hence i had to adapt to different cultures and mentalities, and along the way formed an international mindset that has guided me well through my own challenges in my personal and professional life. 

I started to live on my own at 17, and to code at 18 (later than the average age) . My first languages were Fortran and C. My coding was limited to scripting low level code for robotic projects based on Arduino. In a way it was my first foray into Computer Vision. Later in my twenties , I transitioned from Hardware to Software Engineering, teaching myself Algebra, Statistics, Python , Machine Learning, and finally Deep Learning.

I am curious, which is both a vice and a virtue. Other than AI, I naturally like to read on neuroscience, evolution, and astronomy. 

Today, I get to work on projects that i create out of my imagination.
